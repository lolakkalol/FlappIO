# FlappIO

FlappIO is a neural network that kind of learns to play the game "Flappy Bird"
This is a project I did for my "High school" diploma work (In the original language: "Gymnasiearbete").

The code is not efficient it's not pretty but it kind of works ;)

This was written in processing since i did not want to use the graphics libraries in Java
